# Global Videogame Sales (1980-2016)

In this repository, you'll find the preprocessing steps I performed on the data before loading it into Tableau to create a dashboard.

The Dashboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalVideogameSales1980-2016/D-GL2_1).

You can access the original dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales/data). This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies.
It was generated by a scrape of [vgchartz.com](https://www.vgchartz.com/).
